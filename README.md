Q. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

It was a program to read the daily intake file for the corner grocer. It would allow the user to search for what information they needed and the histograms allow to easily scanand see what items sold the most and least just at a glance. 

Q. What did you do particularly well?

I headed off potential issues by normalizing case and singular words. So if you type in apple it would show you Apples. 

Q. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

The code only reads the txt file that is stated. It would probably be useful to make it to where the user could choose what file to read. 

Q. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The normalizing words code really had my number or a while. It was a challenge to try to get it to work but I googled it to see how others worked the code and with some fine tuning I got it to work out. 

Q. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Separating the program into multiple files will help me get used to tracking multiple files and linking them together.

Q. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Splitting the file makes it so that future code can be added while keeping the foundational main.cpp unaffected or that main can be adjusted but not affect the other files.
